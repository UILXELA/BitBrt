# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Our project is a decentralized social credit system that fit in current system seamlessly. A dynamic group of organizations are authorized to log events to people's credit history and cause changes in their scores. Individual score checking requires authorization while can be done very easily, making it safe but easy. Data is kept entirely on the chain, which creates a fair game for everyone thus attracting participations beyond nationality,  industry, and social background.

# Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
We want to make the system robust and simple. We did not find API's that satisfy our design. So most of the app is hardcoded in JavaScript and a smart contract is written in solidity. We had an idea to integrate Bloom's API but due to time-constraint, we did not finish the interface.
